## Example ADR

# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-15

## Context
We need to choose a primary database for our e-commerce platform. The database needs to handle:
- High read/write throughput
- Complex queries for reporting
- ACID transactions for orders
- Scale to 1M+ products

## Decision Drivers
- Need for relational data with complex relationships
- Requirement for ACID transactions
- Team familiarity
- Open source preference
- Cloud compatibility

## Considered Options

### Option 1: PostgreSQL
**Pros**: ACID, JSON support, mature, open source, excellent performance
**Cons**: Horizontal scaling complexity

### Option 2: MySQL
**Pros**: Popular, well-supported, familiar
**Cons**: Less feature-rich, JSON support not as good

### Option 3: MongoDB
**Pros**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling
**Cons**: Not ideal for relational data, eventual consistency

## Decision
We decided on **PostgreSQL** because:
- Strong ACID guarantees for order transactions
- Excellent JSON support for flexible product attributes
- Team has experience with PostgreSQL
- Good cloud support (RDS, Cloud SQL)
- Rich ecosystem of tools

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reliable transactions for orders
- Flexible querying for analytics
- Well-documented and supported

### Negative
- Need to plan for read replicas for scaling
- More complex sharding if needed later
